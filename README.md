# TIMAPS
TIMAPS (Technical Interoperability Maturity Assessment of a Public Service) is a user-friendly online questionnaire, designed as a self-assessment tool to assist public service owners to evaluate key technical interoperability aspects of their digital public service.

Technical interoperability focuses on the technical aspects of linking information systems and services. It includes aspects such as interface specifications, interconnection services, data integration services, data presentation and exchange, syntactic definitions, etc. Technical Interoperability is usually associated with hardware/software components, systems and platforms that enable machine-to-machine communication to take place. The interoperability of information systems is essential in providing integrated government services.

On completion of the survey, the public service owners receive tailored feedback and recommendations on how to further improve their service in terms of technical interoperability.

TIMAPS serves complementary to the IMAPS survey and its use is recommended in conjunction with IMAPS, to vertically assess the behavioural aspects of a digital public service, from the technical behavioural interoperability viewpoint.
